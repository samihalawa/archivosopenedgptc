            Our card payment system without the need for ID verification is undergoing maintenance. If you don't mind passing verification when withdrawing your GptCoins funds (either when withdrawing by bank transfer to your bank account or when withdrawing cryptocurrencies to another external wallet) you can use the following link that will take you to a special page to GptCoins VIP payments, where you can make your payment.
            <br><br>
            The VIP payment page is similar to an online store. This is done to combat bots and other electronic risks.
            <br><br>
            Remember that you will have to prove that the card you use is yours (for example, in addition to your ID card or passport we will ask you for a photograph of the card you used for payment showing only the first 4 figures. We may request a selfie with your passport.) Only if you are using a card in your name can you get your money from GptCoins.
            <br><br>
            <input type='checkbox' id='inputCheck' value='true'>
            I confirm that I agree with the fact that I will not be able to withdraw my money from GptCoins unless I prove that I am the owner of the card used to make the purchase (for example, by providing a photograph of the card used for payment showing only the first 4 digits and the full name of the holder, which must match yours)
